# Anomaly Detection Pipeline with Quix Streams, Redpanda, and Docker

This project implements a real-time anomaly detection pipeline for stock market data. It utilizes **Quix Streams** for data streaming, **Redpanda** as the message broker, and **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection. The pipeline detects anomalies in stock market data such as high-volume trades and price outliers, which could indicate unusual market behavior.
